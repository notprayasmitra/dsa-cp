// BASIC STRUCTURE OF A PROGRAM IN C++

#include <iostream> // this is a header file in C++

using namespace std; // using this enables us to use various things such as cout, endl
// without the :: operator (ex: std::cout, std::endl)

int main() { // main function of a program, the computer starts from here only, and it needs
    // to be present
    
    cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
    
    return 0; // program ends successfully
}
